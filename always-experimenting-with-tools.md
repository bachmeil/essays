# Why I'm always experimenting with new tools

One of the things I do - and I'm far from alone in this - is experiment with new tools *all the freaking time.* Just a few examples:

- Todoist is my main task manager, but I use other task managers.
- Emacs is my main text editor, but I use Vim and others regularly.
- Geany is my main programming editor, but I use Emacs and others regularly.
- Ubuntu is my main OS, but I use Windows and other variants of Linux sometimes.

Why do I do this? It seems irrational. My current tools work perfectly fine for what I need to do.

I have my reasons. It's such a habit to constantly be experimenting that I feel like I'm doing something wrong if I commit to a tool and don't experiment with others.

By far the biggest reason I do this is because the tool reflects a philosophy towards getting work done. Different philosophies work well in different circumstances. Life is constantly evolving, and I don't want to be caught flat-footed because I'm narrowly focused on using what works right now. If there's a better way to do something, I want to know about it. What I don't want is to limit what I do to the things my tools do well. That seems strange, but it's actually pretty common. I do not want that to be a limiting factor on what I accomplish. They're tools, not family, and I don't really care if they're offended if I use something else.

# Dealing with lots of stuff

One of the problems I deal with is processing the volume of stuff that's coming at me all the time. It doesn't stop:

- Email of all kinds (requests, urgent information, cc, spam, things I might want to check out later, ...)
- Things I see on the internet (papers I want to read, social media, links that might be useful in the future, a sale that ends in six hours, ...)
- Text messages
- Physical mail and things I see
- Pieces of in-person conversations

Beyond the usual suspects that I've listed above, there's also the stuff that needs doing even though there's no message. If you have to get your hair cut, nobody's going to tell you it's time, though after you're *way* overdue for a haircut, you'll notice. You need to handle this stuff *before* it blows up on you.

And then more "stuff" coming at you is the time that's passing where you're not working on the important stuff that won't blow up. If you're going to write the Great American Novel (TM), that'll only happen if you're intentional about doing it. You'll go year after year without working on it, and it'll just never get done.

Collecting stuff as it comes in is the easy part. It's making decisions, properly processing and storing, and doing the needed tasks that's hard.

I've found a few things that don't work. I've tried Jira and Clubhouse. Neither is designed to handle things coming in with that kind of volume.

I've come to the conclusion that processing large volumes of assorted stuff is a complicated problem. That means the solutions will probably be complicated. The real source of my stress has been that I've been looking for a silver bullet that will automate the handling of all this processing. That'll never happen. I need to consider more complicated systems that are maybe not a lot of fun to use.

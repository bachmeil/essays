# Focused Websites

I'm a big fan of plain websites. I positively *hate* what the web has become over the last 15 years. It's all about "design" these days.

Don't get me wrong. By definition, I don't like ugly websites. The question is the metric you use to measure ugliness. For me, a site is ugly if it's hard to read, slow, or has other "features" that slow me down. I want to do what I'm doing as fast as possible.

These days, functionality is not considered important. All that matters for design is that it looks pretty (though many of them fail at that too).

I like Pinboard because it's not one of those ugly sites. It's a well-designed site that just happens to be plain.

What I really like is when a site is plain and then I click the reader view button in Firefox and I can navigate through it quickly. My only complaint with that is that there is no way (that I know of) to change the CSS for reader view.

# Rethinking the blog

I've been thinking about blogging lately. What's the purpose of a blog? I suppose that depends on who you are. For some, it's content marketing. For some, it's a sort of journal for their thoughts. For others, it's a way to give back to the world by sharing their knowledge.

In my case, I blog because there are benefits to doing so. I want to think through something in detail, so I blog about it.

If that's the case, why do I need a framework? Heck, why do I even need an index?

Why not just post my thoughts in markdown in a public repo and let folks do with them as they wish? As long as you give the files an informative name, that's good enough. Github will render markdown files. You can literally just type away, push the file to Github, and walk away. Absolutely no overhead beyond creating the repo.

Maybe I should try that.

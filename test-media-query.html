		<h1>Hash Tables</h1>
		<p>A hash table is a very fast kind of lookup table, somewhat like an alist (see Association Lists) in that it maps keys to corresponding values. It differs from an alist in these ways:</p>

		<li>Lookup in a hash table is extremely fast for large tablesâ€”in fact, the time required is essentially independent of how many elements are stored in the table. For smaller tables (a few tens of elements) alists may still be faster because hash tables have a more-or-less constant overhead.</li>
		<li>The correspondences in a hash table are in no particular order.</li>
		<li>There is no way to share structure between two hash tables, the way two alists can share a common tail. </li>

		<p>Emacs Lisp provides a general-purpose hash table data type, along with a series of functions for operating on them. Hash tables have a special printed representation, which consists of <code>#s</code> followed by a list specifying the hash table properties and contents. See Creating Hash. (Hash notation, the initial <code>#</code> character used in the printed representations of objects with no read representation, has nothing to do with hash tables. See Printed Representation.)</p>

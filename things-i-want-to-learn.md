# Things I want to learn in the next ten years

I love learning new things, new ways of thinking, new ways of attacking problems. My philosophy is that it's better to err on the side of accidentally wasting too much time learning new things rather than too little. As a matter of fact, I'm not a believer in the theory that you can waste time learning things. It might not be the *best possible* use of your time, but it's a good use of your time, so long as you are able to put food on the table.

This is a list of things I'm going to learn in the next decade (2020-2029). I'll look back at this list at the end of 2029 and we'll see how I did. It's not intended to be complete; this is something I'm throwing together while sitting on the edge of my mattress on a Sunday afternoon. I'll update it as other things come to mind.

It's also not directly professional. I have many interests beyond those related to being a research macroeconomist.

# Econometrics

- A solid knowledge of all the standard causal inference tools. I have *some* understanding of them, but far from an expert's understanding. Most of those tools were developed after I took courses in grad school.
- A better understanding of identification.
- How to prove things. I'm honestly not good at proving things. I plan to be more specific about this one in the future, and will update as I make a decision about what I want to prove.
- Complete my knowledge of Bayesian inference.
- Particle filtering/sequential Monte Carlo
- Kalman filtering (more than the elementary knowledge I have now)

# Macroeoconomics

- Solution methods for nonlinear DSGE models.
- Estimation of nonlinear DSGE models.
- Estimation of TVP models with heteroskedasticity.
- Using micro data to estimate the parameters of macro models.

# Programming

- Haskell (current knowledge - very little)
- OCaml (current knowledge - only a little more than Haskell)
- Perl (specifically Mojolicious and Dancer)
- Ruby on Rails
- Authentication concepts
- Large-scale database implementation, sharding, replication
- How to build a cloud app that can store large volumes of individual personal information securely, including notes, links, PDFs of papers, etc., at a reasonable cost, with fine-grained control over what to store locally.

# Tools

- Solid understanding of Vim.
- Extending Fossil with CGI.
- Customizing and theming Fossil.
- rclone
